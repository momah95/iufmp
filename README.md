Data4Governance-Hackerthon

The Natives (our team) took part in our first Hackathon(which we won) hosted by cchubnigeria and sponsored by the worldbank. It involved using geospatial data to help with good governance. We were able to use design thinking to find a problem statement that enabled us use grid3global geospatial data amongst others to develop a platform that can help with the Ibadan flooding. The tools we used involved: R for the analysis, QGIS for working with the geojson file, mapbox.js,HTML,javascript,CSS for building the platform.
